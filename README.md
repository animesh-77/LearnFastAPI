I wanted to brush up on my FastAPI skills and decided to create a simple API. Following some amazing tutorials 

1. main.py was made following the tutorial by Arjan at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SORiTsvnU28 . a simple API that allows you to create, read, update and delete inventory items.

2. main2.py was made following the tutorial by Travis at https://youtu.be/cbASjoZZGIw?si=3IHPLHaFW9s_MDg6 - a simple API that allows you to create, read, update and delete a todo list
